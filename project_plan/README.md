# Project: Gemini-Code - A VS Code Fork with Integrated Multi-Agent AI CLI

## 1. Vision & Goals

**Vision:** To create a seamless and powerful development experience by deeply integrating multiple AI capabilities directly into a fork of Visual Studio Code, tentatively named "Gemini-Code". This will provide developers with a highly intelligent and intuitive coding environment, leveraging the power of generative AI from multiple providers for a variety of development tasks.

**Inspiration:** This project draws inspiration from existing AI-assisted development tools like Cursor and Windsurf, aiming to provide a similar level of integration and functionality.

**Core Goals:**

*   **Deep Integration:** `gemini-cli` will not be a simple extension, but a core component of the editor, enabling it to interact with all aspects of the development workflow.
*   **Intuitive User Experience:** The integration will be designed to be as natural and unobtrusive as possible, augmenting the existing VS Code experience without disrupting it.
*   **Powerful AI Features:** Gemini-Code will provide a comprehensive suite of AI-powered features, including code generation, refactoring, debugging, and more.
*   **Extensibility:** The integration will be designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new `gemini-cli` commands and features in the future.
*   **Multi-Model Compatibility:** Support for multiple AI providers including `gemini-cli`, `claude-code-sdk`, and `openai-agent-sdk`.
